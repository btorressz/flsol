## ðŸ“– Overview

**$FLSOL** is a next-generation DeFi infrastructure protocol deployed on Solana.  
It allows users to stake SOL, mint liquid staking tokens ($FLSOL), and enables flash-loan contracts and bots to **flash borrow** $FLSOL for arbitrage, liquidation, and MEV extraction strategies.

The protocol combines:
- âœ… Liquid staking
- âœ… Flash loanability
- âœ… Treasury fee splitting
- âœ… Maximum flash loan limits
- âœ… Flash loan cooldown enforcement
- âœ… Dynamic fee tiers
- âœ… Full treasury management

  **THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY BEING DEVELOPED IN SOLANA PLAYGROUND IDE next version will be expanded to vscode**

  Flash loan users are subject to a configurable cooldown period between flash loans to prevent abuse.
